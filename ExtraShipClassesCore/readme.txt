    - stationsiegegun - Adds a special weapon to the ship that casues it to fire globs of energy that can deal absurd amounts of damage. Despite its name, it can be mounted on a ship.

    - terminalblocker - Unlike megablocker, this script does actually jam hyperspace in the entire sector.
    - torpedoslammer - This enemy will spew a constant stream of powerful torpedoes.

Most of the above scripts can be customized in some way. Make sure to look at the individual script for what values can be messed with.

Adds the following quality-of-life functions to PirateGenerator:

    - createScaledPirateByName(name, position)
    - createPirateByName(name, position) - Both of these functions will create a pirate ship using the name passed in.
    - getStandardPositions(positionCT, distance) - Gets a table of standard positions based on the normal ship positions in pirateattack.lua. positionCT is the number of positions you want, and distance will specify the distance between the positions.

This also adds similar functions to ShipGenerator.
