Includes extra pirate ship classes and all sorts of neat scripts that you can use to make the player's life much more interesting. As always, this mod does nothing by itself and its functions must be invoked by another mod to use the new ships / scripts.\n\nConsult the readme file for a quick overview of what this mod can offer.",
